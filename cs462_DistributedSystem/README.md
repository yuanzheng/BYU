Overview

For the class project, we will be building a website that allows users to submit pictures and comment on 
and rate other user's submissions.

This system is for the purposes of teaching distributed system architecture. Each lab is a piece of a 
system that works together to provide a picture contest website. Users can submit pictures, rate pictures, 
and leave comments on pictures. All pictures and comments are reviewed before posting on the website.

Not all services required to run this website will be built by students. In particular, a Class Server 
will provide load balancing services and logging services. DNS services will also need to be configured 
prior to students building their labs.
